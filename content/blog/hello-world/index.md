This is our first post on our new Boardgame Blog! How exciting!

A little bit about us:

> We are a group of friends and family who have a varrying amount of boardgame and tabletop gaming experience, from
> a few who have only been playing games for the last year or two, to others who have spent over ten years gaming. 
> We came together over the last couple of weeks and decided to make a boardgame blog, so hopefully people could 
> enjoy the same games that we do!
