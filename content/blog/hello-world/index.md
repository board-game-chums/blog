Welcome to Board Game Chum!

So who the heck are we? 

SETH: We are three cousins who grew up together playing games. From Super Mario 3 on the Nintendo Entertainment System to HeroClix on the living room floor, we have tried our hands at many different forms of gaming.

CHANTZ: Anywhere we could carve out some space to play, we did. We even thought it would be smart to play a card game on the forest floor while camping... with no card sleeves. About a decade ago, I began a grand adventure into the "Golden Age of Board Games". Settlers of Catan along with Marvel Legendary were the two go-to games in my formative board game years. They showed me that board games could be so much more than just Monopoly or Life.

SETH: Hey, when you got a little plastic car full of blue and pink pegs, you are livin' it up my man. For me, my board game revival started only a few years ago. Placing tiny train cars in Ticket to Ride really got my blood pumping for more. Since then, I have filled up shelves full of various titles. 

CHANTZ: I remember that Christmas. We dabbled in Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders and one other game no one can remember. Ooooo spooky. Now you may be wondering where the third cousin is and why he has remained so silent in this post. 

SETH: That would be Tyler. He will be running a lot of the behind the scenes stuff on the site and may make an appearance every now and then on something. Who knows?

CHANTZ: He has also had a history similar to mine with board games. Recenty all of our game shelves have been expanding and we thought starting this blog might be useful to other gamers in this day and age.

SETH: Yeah, as someone who has been researching different games like a madman, we thought having another source of information could be helpful. Plus it gives us some excueses for playing more games.

CHANTZ: Right now, we plan on having at least one post a month on here. 

SETH: As we get our feet underneath us though, we will be posting more and more. We hope you will join us on this new journey to chart a sea of board games for the curious player.

CHANTZ: Hop aboard and welcome to Jurassic...

SETH: NOPE! Not that one. 

CHANTZ: Oh yeah, sorry. Welcome to Board Game Chum.
